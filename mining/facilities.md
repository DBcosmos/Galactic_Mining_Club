# üè≠ Facilities

Currently, the Galactic Mining Club has access to a 2-story, 3200-square-foot facility located in upstate New York. This facility is ready to go, with power and ventilation in place, and operational hardware already. As the Club continues to expand, additional facilities will be targeted that provide energy-efficient options (e.g. low electricity costs, green initiatives) to minimize overhead and continue to provide a sustainable product to holders.

This facility is owned and operated by the Club's founder, Hashimoto.
