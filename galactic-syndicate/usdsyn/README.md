### Tokenomics

**Max Supply:** 100,000\
**Inflation:** 0%\
**Deflation:** Variable

### What is $SYN?

$SYN is the minting token of the Galactic Syndicate (GS) NFTs. Each GS costs 10 $SYN. \


### How to buy $SYN?

$SYN will be available to purchase via a stream event. Users will deposit $INJ and in return receive their portion of $SYN once the Stream has concluded. This stream event will allow for fair price discovery of the token and allow users ample opportunity to add and remove liquidity based on what they deem to be a fair price per token.

Should users fail to take part in the stream event or not acquire at least 10 $SYN to mint a GS NFT, users will also have the opportunity to trade the $SYN token on either WhiteWhale DEX or Dojo Swap. These pools will be seeded with liquidity by the core team.

### How is $SYN deflationary?

All $SYN used to mint a Galactic Syndicate NFT will be burnt, decreasing the supply and ensuring no more NFTs can be minted using the same tokens.&#x20;
