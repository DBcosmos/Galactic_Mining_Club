# ü§ù Partnerships

We are currently partnered with the Galactic Punks, Lion DAO, GP4719, Solar DAO, Codex (formerly WeFund), as well as NiceHash as our mining pool partner. These partnerships will help facilitate rewards distribution, provide legal advice, marketing and community outreach, and continue to streamline processes and provide greater revenue/utility to holders.

If you or your team wish to form a partnership with the Galactic Mining Club, please reach out via our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/FjgqZaQ9bp) or [Telegram](https://t.me/Galactic\_Miners)
