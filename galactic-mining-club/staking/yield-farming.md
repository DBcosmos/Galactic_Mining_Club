# üßë‚Äçüåæ Yield Farming

In addition to mining operations, the Galactic Mining Club will also utilise a suite of Decentralised Finance (DeFi) strategies available across the Cosmos ecosystem, along with traditional staking to supplement this income. Exploration of additional opportunities to supplement the return for holders, and grow the Club‚Äôs reach, will occur on an ongoing basis. To show our support for the Cosmos ecosystem, all rewards generated through these strategies will be converted to the chain‚Äôs native token before distribution to stakers.

The club remains vigilant and proactive in its pursuit of additional opportunities to enhance returns for its stakeholders and expand its reach within the blockchain space. Through ongoing research, analysis, and experimentation, the club identifies emerging trends, explores new partnerships, and evaluates novel strategies to optimize performance and drive growth. This commitment to continuous improvement ensures that the club remains at the forefront of innovation within the Cosmos ecosystem, delivering maximum value to its community of stakeholders.
