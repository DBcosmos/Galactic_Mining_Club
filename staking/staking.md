# ðŸ¥© Staking

Holders of Galactic Miners will be able to stake their NFTs through [EnterpriseDAO](https://dao.enterprise.money/). Staking will be the only option to earn revenue generated by the Club, as NFTs that are not staked (e.g. those for sale on the market or held in a wallet) will not be entitled to disbursement of mining revenue. Stakers are encouraged to contribute to the future success of the Club by participating in governance votes and suggesting DeFi strategies. **There is no minimum stake weight to earn rewards, so a user needs only one to begin earning staking rewards through the Galactic Mining Club.**

### Unstaking

Unstaking waiting period NFTs will be available for claiming 7 days after unstaking. During the unstaking period, NFTs will not be eligible for reward. After the unstaking period ends the NFTs are claimable via [Enterprise DAO](https://dao.enterprise.money/dao/staking?address=terra17f7axfawa0k7k6tdq0ha0zzrfgun0cqp8ex5smjtq6528x9t3wfse2txjv)
