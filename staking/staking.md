# ðŸ¥© Staking

Holders of Galactic Miners will be able to stake their NFTs through [EnterpriseDAO](https://dao.enterprise.money/). Staking will be the only option to earn revenue generated by the Club, as NFTs that are not staked (e.g. those for sale on the market or held in a wallet) will not be entitled to disbursement of mining revenue. Stakers are encouraged to contribute to the future success of the Club by participating in governance votes and suggesting DeFi strategies. **There is no minimum stake weight to earn rewards, so a user needs only one to begin earning staking rewards through the Galactic Mining Club.**

To create or vote on a proposal, GMC members must stake a minimum of 1 NFT. Staking locks your NFT for a set period and ensures that only those with a vested interest in the DAO can participate in its governance.

Any DAO member can use proposals to decide changes or actions of the DAO. These proposals can be to spend the treasury, change the configuration of a DAO, or decide the general direction of a DAO's future. After creating a proposal, DAO members can vote on whether to pass or fail the proposal.

### Proposal Types

| Proposal Type                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text proposals                        | For general proposals, such as directional changes or gaining consensus over an issue, DAO members can submit a text proposal. Text proposals are open-ended and don't take automatic effect or change the configuration of the DAO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| DAO configuration proposals           | This proposal type allows members to change specific configurations of a DAO, such as the [voting period](https://docs.enterprise.money/concepts/governance#voting-period), [threshold](https://docs.enterprise.money/concepts/governance#threshold), [quorum](https://docs.enterprise.money/concepts/governance#quorum), or any other [configuration parameters](https://docs.enterprise.money/concepts/config). DAO configuration proposals generally take effect automatically after passing. Failed proposals leave the DAO configuration unchanged. |
| DAO upgrade proposals                 | This proposal type allows members to upgrade a DAO's contracts to the latest version so that members can enjoy the latest Enterprise features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Proposal to update whitelisted assets | This proposal type allows members to add or remove assets that are displayed on a DAO's treasury page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Proposal to execute message           | This proposal type allows members to craft generic Cosmos/Wasm messages which will be executed by the DAO. This allows the DAO to send funds, interact with smart contracts, delegate/undelegate LUNA from the treasury, etc. Refer to the [Message Templates](https://docs.enterprise.money/guides/messages) section for examples of supported messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Proposal to update multisig members   | This proposal type allows members to add or remove members from a multisig DAO, or modify an existing member's weight. This option is only available for multisig DAOs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Unstaking

Unstaking waiting period NFTs will be available for claiming 7 days after unstaking. During the unstaking period, NFTs will not be eligible for reward. After the unstaking period ends the NFTs are claimable via [Enterprise DAO](https://dao.enterprise.money/dao/staking?address=terra17f7axfawa0k7k6tdq0ha0zzrfgun0cqp8ex5smjtq6528x9t3wfse2txjv)
