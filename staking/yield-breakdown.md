# ➗ Yield Breakdown

10% of all revenue from both DeFi yield generated by the Club and Mining revenue generated by the team on behalf of the Club will be used to back the NFTs. Rewards from DeFi strategies and staking will be harvested regularly (at minimum monthly),converted into the chain’s native asset and distributed to stakers.
